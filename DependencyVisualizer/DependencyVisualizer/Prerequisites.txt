This project is built using Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite but AFAIK any version of Visual Studio 2005 will do to build
the actual Dependency Visualizer application.

- The NGraphwiz.* and Quickgraph.* assemblies come from the MbUnit project (http://www.mbunit.com), currently using version 2.3. 
- To build the setup you need a recent version of Wix 3 (http://wix.sf.net)
- the automagic building of source zip file (included in setup project) requires the MSBuildCommunityTasks (http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/)
